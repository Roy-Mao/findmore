Implemented in generate.c is a program that uses a "pseudorandom-number generator" (via a function called drand48) to generate a whole bunch of random (well, pseudorandom, since computers canâ€™t actually generate truly random) numbers, one per line, each of which is in [0, LIMIT), where LIMIT is a constant defined within the file, so to speak. That is, each is greater than or equal to 0 and less than LIMIT.
